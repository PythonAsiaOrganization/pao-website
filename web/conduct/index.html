<li><strong>Focusing on what is best for the community.</strong> We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.  </li>
<li><strong>Acknowledging time and effort.</strong> We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that oftentimes the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.  </li>
<li><strong>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.</strong> We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.  </li>
